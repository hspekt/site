I did undergrad in chemistry [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu) thanks to a wonderful high school chemistry teacher, then was incredibly fortunate to work for the Proteomic Core at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org). These experience have led me to graduate school at [Northeastern University Department of Bioengineering](http://www.bioe.neu.edu/) and the [Slavov lab](https://slavovlab.net/index.html) where I get to (okay, try to) solve proteomics and biology puzzles all day! 

Feel free to contact me at `specht.h at husky dot neu dot edu` to discuss any of the following topics: 

  - Finding a great graduate school mentor
  - Graduate school in general
  - Proteomics
  - R programming
  - Mountain biking...
